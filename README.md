<h1> Introduction</h1>

This repository hosts a collection of data science projects completed by me as a part of either independent initiatives or certification programs. The process of coding for the project, in turn, has honed my problem solving and coding skills. The notebooks hosted in the repository are ready to be run and reused by fellow coders.
